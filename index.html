<h2>My name is Shirley Wang. I'm a writer from Iowa City.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In 2018, I wrote a radio story called <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/12/14/lin-wang-charles-barkley"> "&ldquo;My Dad's Friendship with Charles Barkley";</a> for NPR&rsquo;s Only A Game. </p>
<p> It was about my late father and his unlikely friendship with the retired basketball player.

    It was also mentioned in Sunday Long Read Best of 2018, The New York Times Newsletter and Politico's Playbook, and was listed as NBC's top '13 moments in Asian America that moved us in 2018.' It ran in an issue of Reader's Digest in 2019 and was noted in Best American Sports Writing 2019.&nbsp;</p>
