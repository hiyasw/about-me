<h2>My name is Shirley Wang. I'm a writer from Iowa City.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In 2018, I wrote a radio story called <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/12/14/lin-wang-charles-barkley">&ldquo;My Dad's Friendship with Charles Barkley&rdquo;</a> for NPR&rsquo;s Only A Game about my late father and his unusual friendship with a retired basketball player. You can hear more about this story from <a href="https://www.today.com/video/inside-charles-barkley-s-unlikely-friendship-with-scientist-1399939139535">the Today Show</a> and Charles Barkley&rsquo;s interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp-y8LkmTl4&amp;ab_channel=JimmyKimmelLive">Jimmy Kimmel</a>. I especially loved talking about the story with Charity Nebbe, a talk show host at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210421045258/https://www.iowapublicradio.org/show/talk-of-iowa/2018-12-21/unlikely-friendships-and-a-musical-miracle-heartwarming-stories-of-2018">Iowa Public Radio</a>, who dives deep into me and my dad&rsquo;s relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you liked my story, you might like reading the follow-up I wrote for Father&rsquo;s Day called <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2019/06/14/shirley-wang-lin-charles-barkley-reflection">How to Grieve in Front Of Millions Of People</a>, or this story about the&nbsp;<a href="https://popula.com/2018/10/11/how-we-got-here/">Chinese Church in Iowa City</a>, where my&nbsp;dad hosted New Year&rsquo;s parties, or this story I wrote about <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2019/11/15/global-kid-media-kid-journalist-vedant-gupta">Vedant Gupta, an 13-year-old sports media influencer</a>, whose dad is also greatly entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
